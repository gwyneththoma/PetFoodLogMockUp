# PetFoodLogMockUp
A Java mockup of a web app that tracks how much food you have fed your pet. There are four classes User: Keeps track of the username, password, and pet that the owner takes care of Pet: Keeps track of the pet's name, petID, and the pet's food budget, what they are supposed to eat each day TrackUpdate: keeps track of the food fed to a pet RunApp: a main class, which runs the app. It is set to run until midnight, when it will terminate. It has a list of users, and a list of updates. It first asks a user to login. If the user is already known, then the app continues, otherwise a new user is created, along with a new pet with the name provided by the user. Then, it asks the user how much they have fed their pet(in cups), updates the pet, adds the new amount to the total fed to the pet that day, and then informs the user whether they have fed the pet too much, too little, or just enough.
